# MSci-Project

Repository for my MSci research project as part of my final year studying Physics with Astrophysics MSci at the University of Glasgow. The project is titled "Using PINNs to solve black hole perturbations" and, at the moment, is open-ended in its approximate goal. The project is to last two UofG semesters and will culminate in a 20 page dissertation write-up and a 15 minute presentation of my work. I had my first meeting with my supervisor, John Veitch, and co-supervisor, Chris Messenger, today and look forward to our weekly meetings.

The first steps of the project are to:
- Install Pytorch and create a small, low-level Neural Network
- Engage with some of the literature surrounding Black Hole Perturbation Theory
